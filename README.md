# Eat-Da-Burger!
## A restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burger they would like to eat.

*Eat-Da-Burger!* is a restaurant app that allows users to choose a burger they would like to eat. As shown in the demo below, the user can input the name of a burger and subsequently, a *devour* button will be attached to the burger. The user can choose at any point to eat the burger by clicking on the *devour* button or input more burger names. After the user eats the burger, the burger name is moved to the list of eaten burgers.

The app is designed to be a fun activity for users. For a large group of users, the app could be used by restaurants to analyze user's preferences and organize their menus. A feature that I would like to include is a category that allows users to order their *devoured burgers* from their favorite restaurants.

*Please note the app uses Node.js and Express for its server environment and MYSQL for its database.*. To use this app, please click on its web page(see *Accessing deployed app*).
